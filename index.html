    <h1>Don't Stop Me Now</h1>
    <h4>by <a href="http://www.queenonline.com">Queen</a></h4>
    <p>I love Queen</p>
    <p>Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time <br>
        I feel alive and the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah<br>
        And floating around in ecstasy<br>
        So don't stop me now don't stop me<br>
        'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time</p>
    <p>I'm a shooting star, leaping through the sky <br>
        Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity<br>
        I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva<br>
        I'm gonna go, go, go<br>
        There's no stopping me<br>
    </p>
    <p>I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah <br>
        Two hundred degrees<br>
        That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit<br>
        I'm traveling at the speed of light<br>
        I wanna make a supersonic man out of you<br>
    </p>
    <p>Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time <br>
        I'm having a ball<br>
        Don't stop me now<br>
        If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call<br>
        Don't stop me now ('cause I'm having a good time)<br>
        Don't stopâ€¦
    </p>
